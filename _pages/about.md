Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I'm currently a forth-year PhD candidate @ [Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab (iDVX Lab)](https://idvxlab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Nan Cao](https://nancao.org/). I do research in **natural language-driven data visualization** and seek to explore how data visualization is empowered by language models in the era of AIGC.

I received my Master’s degree in Financial mathematics in School of Mathematics And Statistics, UNSW, supervised by Prof. Yanan Fan and [Prof. Yuguang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Science from University of Toronto and a double degree in Mathematics and Finance.

:star2: I will be on job market in June 2024. Looking for opportunities in AIGC, Data Visualization, Quant Trading. Feel free to drop me an email.
