Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I'm currently a forth-year PhD candidate @ Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab (iDVX Lab). I do research in natural language-driven data visualization and seek to explore how data visualization is empowered by language models in the era of AIGC.

I received my Master’s degree in Financial mathematics in [School of Mathematics And Statistics, UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths), supervised by Prof. Yanan Fan and [Prof. Yuguang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Science from University of Toronto and a double degree in Mathematics and Finance.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

:star2: I will be in job market in June 2024. Looking for opportunities in quantitative trading or AIGC startups.
