Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! 

I am a senior machine learning scientist @ Paypal GADS. I do research in **natural language-driven data visualization** and seek to explore how data visualization is empowered by language models in the era of AIGC. I received my Ph.D. from Tongji University [Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab (iDVX Lab)](https://idvxlab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Nan Cao](https://nancao.org/). 

I received my Master’s degree in Financial mathematics in School of Mathematics And Statistics, UNSW, supervised by Prof. Yanan Fan and [Prof. Yuguang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Science from University of Toronto and a double degree in Mathematics and Finance.
