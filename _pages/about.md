Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! 

I am a senior machine learning scientist @ Paypal, where I focus on **promoting and innovating Agentic AI** technologies within PayPal. My work spans across **ChatBI** and **AI+SDLC** domains, exploring how AI agents can revolutionize business intelligence and software development processes. I do research in **Agentic AI**, **AI+Data**, **Data Visualization**, exploring the potential of LLMs in transforming how we interact with data and build intelligent systems. I received my Ph.D. from Tongji University [Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab (iDVX Lab)](https://idvxlab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Nan Cao](https://nancao.org/). 

I received my Master’s degree in Financial mathematics in School of Mathematics And Statistics, UNSW, supervised by Prof. Yanan Fan and [Prof. Yuguang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Science from University of Toronto and a double degree in Mathematics and Finance.
