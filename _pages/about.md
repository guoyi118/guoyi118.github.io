Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I'm currently a forth-year PhD candidate @ Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab (iDVX Lab). I do research in **natural language-driven data visualization** and seek to explore how data visualization is empowered by language models in the era of AIGC.

I received my Master’s degree in Financial mathematics in [School of Mathematics And Statistics, UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths), supervised by Prof. Yanan Fan and [Prof. Yuguang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Science from University of Toronto and a double degree in Mathematics and Finance.

:star2: I will be on job market in June 2024. Looking for opportunities in quantitative trading or AIGC startups. Feel free to drop me an email.
